    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a diligent, analytical, and driven undergraduate seeking 
        experiential learning in the information technology industry. 
        My goals are to learn more about the technology industry and use my knowledge
        from the hospitality industry in conjunction. I aspire to further my education 
        and pursue a masters degree within the next 3 years. Having composure when faced 
        with stressful situations and superior communication skills will allow me to contribute
        very productively in these fields. I am currently aspiring to be a programmer growing my skills
        everyday. This project was entirely build using HTML,CSS and Javascript With Flexbox for desgning.
